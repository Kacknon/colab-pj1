###10/11/2016
 Created Three Directories [ Changelog, Overview, UserStory ]. Created (and updated) Master Changelog masterlog.md _-DB_

###10/12/2016
 Populated user story document. _-DB_

###1/15/2017  
 Wrote some example code to give a feel for the ideas behind the game loop. I also commented the code to some degree.
Inform me if the commenting isn't substantial enough to convey my intent. Also wrote up a list of action items for us to ponder. -DB

###1/18/2017
  Began the creation of a basic character customization system. Added charAtts class to hold character selections.
Will most likely evolve into something far greater than hair color or clothes color. _-EB_

###1/19/2017
  Continued to evolve character customization. Changed customization object instantiation from "playerLook" to "charAppear" to signify
 that it is infact appearance related. Also changed if else statements to switches in order to de clutter the code.
 Also continued to add dialogue, although my dialogue writing skills are nowhere near the caliber of my collegue. _-EB_

###1/20/2017
  Finished what is our based character customization system. Created a VS project.
Went through and fixed some bugs and syntatical errors. Plan is to add weapon selection system in next. _-EB_

###1/22/2017
  Restored the code to a functional form. Modifyied the Readme portion of our project. Restructured the **masterlog** to
 represent the visual design that I think would improve readability. 
 
 ###1/23/2017
  Debugged some of the switches. _-EB_
