												Text Based Adventure:




This is where we will compile an overview of the project. We will work together to define the scope and our general ideas.

I have created several folders within the project. The first being for documentation. There are three folders within the documentation folder. Changelog, Overvew and UserStory.

Obviously, any changes made can be written and saved in the Changelog  folder. The format (assuming you agree) should be: date/time(time is optional), summary(brief description of the changes made), and initials (DB for me, and whatever you choose).

Overview will be used as a repoitory for general ideas. "Tutorials". Effectively "We need to do this, and this is how.".

UserStory is where we will write the agreed upon attributes/features of our application. First in a "Average Joe" description. Below that a techinical description of how this will be implemented.


Next project folder is Main. Main will be where working code is placed. The idea being that we should seperate our testing/code snippets seperate from the Main codebase.

The final project folder is Test. Test, as the name would suggest will be where tests are run. For instance. I want to test an objects functionality. I want to verify that this class is working properly. I want to verify that this loop does what I want.




If you wish to make any additions here, feel free to do so. This will be a repository for unpolished ideas, quick thoughts, etc...

Okay, so here is the current gameplan:

The main loop needs to consist of a boolean condition. This will act as a placeholder menu of sorts. Once we have a bit of content, we can start thinking about the "menu" system.
Currently I have a verrrry small "game" in place. It has next to no content. No systems are in place, etc...

What we need to do next, is determine what our first item to work on is. I will start the priority list, but I won't be able to think of everything.

1. Main Loop functionality (i.e. error handling, ease of use, user interface, ASCII art).
2. Handling of user input (i.e. "What if the user does this". We need to be pithy and clever(God help us)).
3. Room system.
4. Movement system.
5. Inventory system.
6. Materials system.
7. Item list.
8. Enemy types.
9. Enemy descriptions.
10. Combat system.
11. Magic?
12. Randomization (in dialogue, in the "Looting" system, in enemy encounters, in rooms, in everything).
13. TBD.
