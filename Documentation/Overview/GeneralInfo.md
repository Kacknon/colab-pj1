<h2 align="center">Text Based Adventure:</h2><br>



<h4>Common Elements of Text Based Adventures:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Narrative</li>
<li>Text Parsing</li>
<li>Item Systems</li>
<li>Exploration</li>
<li>Over World</li>
<li>Under World</li>
<li>Monsters</li>
<li>NPC's</li>
<li>RPG Elements</li>
<li>Combat</li>
</ol>

This is by no means an exhaustive list. It is merely a rough overview of the types of elements(or components) one might encounter in a Text Based Adventure.

Our Text Adventure(_TA_) will have most of the above elements present in one form or another.
One of the most important facets of a _TA_ is the Text Parsing system.
The Text Parsing(_Parser_) is one of the most commonly interacted with element of the a _TA_, and by consequence must be well polished and tested. If the  _Parser_ doesnâ€™t function as the user would expect it to, this will definitely lead to frustration.

###Previous Text--Not currently relevant
~~This is where we will compile an overview of the project. We will work together to define the scope and our general ideas.

~~I have created several folders within the project. The first being for documentation. There are three folders within the documentation folder. Changelog, Overview and UserStory.

~~Obviously, any changes made can be written and saved in the Changelog  folder. The format (assuming you agree) should be: date/time(time is optional), summary(brief description of the changes made), and initials (DB for me, and whatever you choose).

~~Overview will be used as a repoitory for general ideas. "Tutorials". Effectively "We need to do this, and this is how.".

~~UserStory is where we will write the agreed upon attributes/features of our application. First in a "Average Joe" description. Below that a techinical description of how this will be implemented.


~~Next project folder is Main. Main will be where working code is placed. The idea being that we should seperate our testing/code snippets seperate from the Main codebase.

~~The final project folder is Test. Test, as the name would suggest will be where tests are run. For instance. I want to test an objects functionality. I want to verify that this class is working properly. I want to verify that this loop does what I want.

~~If you wish to make any additions here, feel free to do so. This will be a repository for unpolished ideas, quick thoughts, etc...
