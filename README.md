### This is our little collaboration project.
  Fundamentally, the project is a means to improve our programming skills through excercise.


#### What is it?  
  Currently the code, and the plan is to make a text based rpg adventure via CSharp.

#### Why write it from scratch and not use a development engine?
   The idea-- Is to write the entire application using as few libraries as possible.
  We want to learn. In order to do that, we need to design and implement the functionality
  and elemnts needed to create and refine our project.

#### How long do you anticipate it taking?
   I expect 4 months of solid work to have a working alpha that satisfies our desired level of complexity.
   After that, the refinement will likely take a few more months.
